# a Go ðŸŒ³ Sitter Forest

_Where a Gopher wanders around and meets lots of ðŸŒ³ Sitters..._

First of all, giving credits where they are due:

This repository started as a fork of @smacker's [go-tree-sitter](https://github.com/smacker/go-tree-sitter) repo
until I realized I don't want to also handle the bindings library itself
in the same project (i.e. the stuff in the root of the repo, exposing `sitter.Language` type
itself & co.), I just want a (big) collection of all the [tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter)
parsers I can add.

So here it is: started with the parsers and the automation from the above
mentioned repo then added a bunch more parsers on top of it and updated
automation (to support more parsers and also to automatically update the
PARSERS.md file, git tags, etc.).

See [PARSERS.md](PARSERS.md) for the list of supported parsers.
The end goal is (at least) parity with [nvim_treesitter](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter?tab=readme-ov-file#supported-languages).

For contributing (or just to see how the automation works) see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Naming Conventions

The language name used is the same as TreeSitter language name (the `name` exported
by grammar.js) and the same as the query folder name in `nvim_treesitter` (where
applicable).

This keeps things simple and consistent.

In rare cases, the Go package name differs from the language name:

- `go` actually has the package name `Go` because `package go` does not go well in Go
  (pun intended) but otherwise the language name remains "go";
- `func` language, same problem as above, so package name is actually `FunC`
  (but everything else is `func` as normal: folder, language name, etc.);
- `context` language, same problem (conflict with stdlib `context` package)
  so it uses the name `ConTeXt`;
- `COBOL` language is named `COBOL` in grammar.js but we expose it as `cobol`
  (for aligning with the rest of the parsers);
- `dotenv` language is named `env` in grammar.js but we expose it as `dotenv`;
- `walnut` language is named `cwal` in grammar.js but we retain it as `walnut`.

Also, some languages may have names that are not very straightforward acronyms.
In those cases, an `altName` field will be populated, i.e. `requirements` language
has an `altName` of `Pip requirements`, `query` has `Tree-Sitter Query Language`
and so on. Search [grammar.json](grammars.json) for your grammar of interest.

## Usage

### Parsers

See the README in [go-tree-sitter-bare](https://github.com/alexaandru/go-tree-sitter-bare),
as well as the `example_*.go` files in this repo.

This repo only gives you the `GetLanguage()` function, you will still use the sibling
repo for all your interactions with the tree.

You can use the parsers in this repo in several ways:

#### 1. Standalone

You can use the parsers one (or more) at a time, as you'd use any other Go package:

```Go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"

	"github.com/alexaandru/go-sitter-forest/risor"
	sitter "github.com/alexaandru/go-tree-sitter-bare"
)

func main() {
	content := []byte("print('It works!')\n")
	node, err := sitter.ParseCtx(context.TODO(), content, risor.GetLanguage())
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	// Do something interesting with the parsed tree...
	fmt.Println(node)
}
```

#### 2. In Bulk

If (and only IF) you want to use ALL (or most of) the parsers (beware, your binary
size **will be huge**, as in 200MB+ huge) then you can use the root (`forest`) package:

```Go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"

	forest "github.com/alexaandru/go-sitter-forest"
	sitter "github.com/alexaandru/go-tree-sitter-bare"
)

func main() {
	content := []byte("print('It works!')\n")
	parser := sitter.NewParser()
	parser.SetLanguage(forest.GetLanguage("risor")())

	tree, err := parser.ParseCtx(context.TODO(), nil, content)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	// Do something interesting with the parsed tree...
	fmt.Println(tree.RootNode())
}
```

this way you can fetch and use any of the parsers dynamically, without having to
manually import them. You should rarely need this though, unless you're writing
a text editor or something.

#### 3. As a Plugin

A third way, ~and perhaps the most convenient~ (no, it's not, it's \~250MB with all
parsers built into the binary whereas all parsers built as plugins took \~1400MB
for all 354 parsers), is to use the included [Plugins.make](Plugins.make)
makefile, which allows easy creation of any and all plugins. Simply copy it to
your repo, and then you can easily `make -f Plugins.make plugin-risor`, etc. or
use the `plugin-all` target which creates all the plugins.

Then you can selectively use them in your app using the [plugins mechanism](https://pkg.go.dev/plugin).

**IMPORTANT:** You **MUST** use `-trimpath` when building your app, when using plugins
(the [Plugins.make](Plugins.make) file already includes it, but the app that uses them also needs it).

#### 4. Your Own Way

You can mix and match the above, obviously.

Probably the best approach would be to build your own "mini-forest", using the forest
package as a template but only including the languages you are interested in.

I'm not excluding offering "mini forests" in the future, guarded by build tags,
if I ever figure some subsets that make sense (most used/popular/known/whatever).

#### Info

Each individual parser (as well as the bulk loader) offers an `Info()` function
which can be used to retrieve information about a parser. It exposes it's entry
from `grammars.json` either raw (as a string holding the JSON encoded entry)
or as an object (only available in bulk mode).

The returned `Grammar` type implements `Stringer` so it should give a nice summary
when printed (to screen or logs, etc.).

### Queries

As of `v1.5.90` the root package not only includes the "parsers forest" but also
the corresponding queries. The queries are compiled from two sources:

1. `nvim_treesitter` project and
2. the individual sitter repos' own `queries` folders.

The queries are embedded in the packages (at the time of writing this, for 359 parsers,
the queries are only 11MB) and they can be fetched exactly the same as languages,
just replace `GetLanguage()` with `GetQuery(kind)` or `forest.GetQuery(lang, kind)`.
They are available for standalone packages, plugins as well as forest itself.

The kind is one of {`highlights`, `indent`, `folds`, etc.} (preferably without the
".scm" extension, but will work with it included as well). I.e. to get the highlights
query for Go, one would call `forest.GetQuery("go", "highlights")`.

You can optionally pass the query lookup preference, see the `NvimFirst`, `NativeFirst`,
etc. in `forest.go` for details, as in: `forest.GetQuery("go", "highlights", forest.NvimOnly)`.

The queries respect the "inherits:" directive (nvim_treesitter specific), recursively,
returning the final query with all inherited queries included, at the forest level.
The individual packages' own GetQuery() obviously cannot do that, since they do not
have access to other parsers' own queries, only the forest has that. See `forest.GetQuery()`
on how to replicate that on your end if using the individual packages.

### File Type Detection

As of `v1.5.106` the root package also includes an (still experimental/WIP) file type
detector: `forest.DetectLanguage(<abs path|rel path|filename>)`. For best results, the
absolute path to the file should be provided as that enables all the available detectors
(glob, full path, filename, by extension - in that order). The language name is obviously
the same as parser and query name.

You can optionally register your own extensions (only for languages that are part of the
forest, as they are validated against it) or override existing extensions (particularly
useful where there is file extension clashing, like both V and Verilog using `.v` file
extension - you can opt for one or the other, etc.). See `forest.RegisterLanguage()` for
details.

## Parser Code Changes

For transparency, any and all changes made to the parsers' (and, to be clear, I
include in this term ALL the files coming from parsers, not just parser.c) files
are documented below.

For one thing ALL changes are fully automated (any exceptions are noted below),
no change is ever made manually, so inspecting the automation should give you a
clear picture of all the changes performed to the code, changes which are detailed below:

- the include paths are rewritten to use a flat structure (i.e. `"tree_sitter/parser.h"`
  becomes `"parser.h"`); This is needed so that the files are part of the same package,
  plus it also makes automation simpler;
- for `unison` the `scanner` file includes `maybe.c` which causes `cgo` to include the file twice and throw duplicate symbols error.
  The solution chosen was to copy the content of the included file into the scanner file and set
  the included file to zero bytes; this way all the code is in one file and the compilation is possible;
- for parsers that include a `tag.h` file: the `TAG_TYPES_BY_TAG_NAME` variable clashes
  between them (when those parsers are all included into one app). The solution chosen
  was to rename the variable by adding the `_<lang>` suffix, i.e., we currently have:
  - `TAG_TYPES_BY_TAG_NAME_astro`;
  - `TAG_TYPES_BY_TAG_NAME_html`;
  - `TAG_TYPES_BY_TAG_NAME_svelte`;
  - `TAG_TYPES_BY_TAG_NAME_vue`;
- for parsers that define `serialize()`, `deserialize()`, `scan()` (and a few others)
  (i.e. `org`, `beancount`, `html` & a few others): the offending identifiers are
  renamed by appending the `_<lang>` suffix to them (i.e. `serialize` -> `serialize_org`, etc.);
  See the `putFile()` function in `internal/automation/main.go` for details;
- some parsers' `grammar.js` files were not yet updated to work with latest TreeSitter,
  in which case we hot patch them before regenerating the parser. See the `replMap` in
  `downloadGrammar()` function;
- **EXCEPTION MANUAL CHANGE**: `poe_filter/parser.c` is currently invalid upon generation
  (is missing a right paren at line 6216, col 50 - I added it manually);
- **EXCEPTION MANUAL CHANGE**: `sdml/parser.c` same as for poe_filter, at line 4125
  the generated parser.c file had an unbalanced (missing) paren.

## Versions & Status

We are currently aligned with TreeSitter `v0.22.2`: [go-tree-sitter-bare](https://github.com/alexaandru/go-tree-sitter-bare)
`v1.1.1` uses `v0.22.2` (and this project uses that latest version of
`go-tree-sitter-bare`) and the included [package.json](package.json)
(which is used for regenerating grammars) is using the same version.

As for the parsers in this repo:

- almost of the parsers are now regenerating the `parser.{c,h}` files
  using the latest `tree-sitter` (they are marked with a heavy checkmark
  in [PARSERS.md](PARSERS.md) and they do NOT have the `skip` flag set
  in [grammars.json](grammars.json)); this is preferred way going further;
- a few parsers could not yet be regenerated locally. They can still
  be used just fine, but they will use whatever `parser.{c,h}` files they
  have in the upstream repo, which may or may not have been compiled with
  the latest `tree-sitter` version (most likely not, or we'd also be able
  to regenerate them). In general they should work too though, that's how
  this project started after all, with downloaded files only.

So there it is, we try to converge towards using the same `tree-sitter`
version everywhere, and keeping up with it too.

## TODO

- implement a "cooldown window" (some experimental/actively developed parsers
  generate a ton of "update noise"): say, do not attempt to update anything that
  was updated in the past N days (let's start with 3?);
- queries needs some more work:
  - only update if needed (commit has changed) on update-queries
    (it already does that when run via update-all, implicitly);
- filter automatically high memory usage parsers and run them one by one (at the end?);
- need to update the parsers automation to create a Go module for a new parser automatically;
  (go mod init+tidy, create \_keep.scm file, go work use, what else... TBD);
- need to be able to auto-delete files deleted remotely (i.e. if a scanner.c or whatever is deleted
  from the source repo, we should also be deleting it locally).
